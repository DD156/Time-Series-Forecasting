# Time Series Forecasting on Electricity Demand

## Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting for electricity demand. It covers multiple aspects of data analysis and model building, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Dealing with Missing Values
- Handling Special Days
- Outlier Analysis
- Data Encoding
- Hyperparameter Tuning with Cross-Validation (Time Series Split)
- Post-Processing Techniques
- Pipeline Creation

## Project Steps

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conduct initial data exploration to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.
- Generate visualizations to summarize key insights from the data.

### Feature Engineering
- Create and transform features to improve the predictive power of the model.
- Include temporal features, lag features, rolling statistics, etc.

### Dealing with Missing Values
- Identify missing values in the dataset.
- Apply techniques to handle and impute missing values appropriately.

### Handling Special Days
- Account for special days such as holidays, weekends, and other significant events that might affect electricity demand.

### Outlier Analysis
- Detect and handle outliers in the data to ensure model robustness.
- Apply statistical methods and visual inspections to identify outliers.

### Data Encoding
- Encode categorical variables to prepare the data for machine learning models.

### Hyperparameter Tuning with Cross-Validation (Time Series Split)
- Implement cross-validation using time series split to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
- Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### Post-Processing Techniques
- Apply techniques to refine and improve the final predictions.
- Include steps such as smoothing, ensemble methods, etc.

### Pipeline Creation
- Develop reusable data processing and model training pipelines for efficient workflow management.
